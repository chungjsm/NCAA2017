March Machine Learning Mania 2017 Kaggle Competition

iPython notebooks containing cleaned data and machine learning model to predict every possible NCAA March Madness matchup in the 2017 tournament. This submission was a collaboration with Gagan Tunuguntla at the Recurse Center. It was ultimately not submitted due to a clerical error but the log loss of our model projects us to be in the top 100 of submissions.
